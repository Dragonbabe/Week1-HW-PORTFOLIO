            <p>My name is Esther Walker. Some of my favorite hobbies are horse-back riding, hiking,
                backpacking and climbing. Living in the Pacific Northwest affords many
                opportunities to enjoy the outdoors until my heart is content! I also enjoy
                running Spartan races and I completed my first Trifecta this year, a combination of the Spartan
                Sprint (3+ miles of
                obstacle racing, 20+ obstacles), the Spartan Super (8+ miles, 25+ obstacles), and the Spartan Beast
                (13+
                miles, 30+ obstacles). I have a goals
                to participate in a half marathon at the end of 2020 and then participate
                in an an Ironman in 2021!</p>
            <p>I got interested in Software Development because it is an amazing place
                to discover new things and challenge myself. In April of this year I started working at Amazon
                with
                the Dex Robotics
                program. It has been so interesting being a part of the culture of Software Development and the
                amazing things technology is accomplishing! I decided to pursue a career in this field
                ultimately
                because there are
                so many fascinating directions and opportunities to pursue! I have only gotten a taste of it in
                my
                new position at Amazon, and I have gotten to learn even more since I started my education with
                the
                UW Coding Bootcamp! It is very exciting and I am ectstatic to be learning more.</p>
