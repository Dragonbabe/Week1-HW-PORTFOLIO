            <p>My name is Esther Walker. I will tell you about a few things that I love.
                I fell in love with horses when I was about nine years old. I still ride
                every chance I get and I have future goals to aquire my own horse farm and
                operate a small breeding and training operation. I also enjoy hiking,
                backpacking and climbing. Living in the Pacific Northwest affords many
                opportunities to enjoy the outdoors until the heart is content!
                I got interested in software developement because it is an amazing place
                to discover new things and challenge myself. I have spent a number of years in
                various types careers and I decided on this one ultimately because there are
                so many fascinating directions and opportunities to pursue!</p>
